## Project Overview

In this project, we aim to investigate possible extensions to tackle the limitations of the VCIP method. The goal is find a elegant, formal, insightful, and promise method that will be submitted to the NeurIPS conference.

With this goal in mind, the overall steps, currently, are:

- Step 1: Understand the VCIP's codebase located at lightning-hydra-template-main/src/vendor/VCIP.
- Step 2: Using the above understanding of the VCIP's codebase, we will try to replicate the results from the paper. Here, we need to adapt the code to run each result presented at the VCIP paper (available at: literature_review/pdfs/VCIP.pdf).
- Step 3: From the execution of the tests, we need to understand the weakeness of VCIP. Here, we need to develop a notebook python that will receive the execution results and analyse them with techniques such as, slice discovery or with simpler techniques.
