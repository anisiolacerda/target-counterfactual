## Audience Profile

Considering our aiming to submitt a paper to the NeurIPS conference (Conference and Workshop on Neural Information Processing Systems is a machine learning and computational neuroscience conference held every December. Along with ICLR and ICML, it is one of the three primary conferences of high impact in machine learning and artificial intelligence research).

Along with machine learning and neuroscience, other fields represented at NeurIPS include cognitive science, psychology, computer vision, statistical linguistics, and information theory.

The resurgence of deep learning[7] in neural networks since 2012, fueled by faster computers and big data, has led to achievements in speech recognition, object recognition in images, image captioning, language translation and world championship performance in the game of Go, based on neural architectures inspired by the hierarchy of areas in the visual cortex (ConvNet) and reinforcement learning inspired by the basal ganglia (Temporal difference learning).

## Call For NeurIPS Papers

The Thirty-Ninth Annual Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) is an interdisciplinary conference that brings together researchers in machine learning, neuroscience, statistics, optimization, computer vision, natural language processing, life sciences, natural sciences, social sciences, and other adjacent fields. We invite submissions presenting new and original research on topics including but not limited to the following:

- Applications (e.g., vision, language, speech and audio, Creative AI)
- Deep learning (e.g., architectures, generative models, optimization for deep networks, foundation models, LLMs)
- Evaluation (e.g., methodology, meta studies, replicability and validity, human-in-the-loop)
- General machine learning (supervised, unsupervised, online, active, etc.)
- Infrastructure (e.g., libraries, improved implementation and scalability, distributed solutions)
- Machine learning for sciences (e.g. climate, health, life sciences, physics, social sciences)
- Neuroscience and cognitive science (e.g., neural coding, brain-computer interfaces)
- Optimization (e.g., convex and non-convex, stochastic, robust)
- Probabilistic methods (e.g., variational inference, causal inference, Gaussian processes)
- Reinforcement learning (e.g., decision and control, planning, hierarchical RL, robotics)
- Social and economic aspects of machine learning (e.g., fairness, interpretability, human-AI interaction, privacy, safety, strategic behavior)
- Theory (e.g., control theory, learning theory, algorithmic game theory)

Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field, and so we welcome interdisciplinary submissions that do not fit neatly into existing categories. We also encourage in-depth analysis of existing methods that provide new insights in terms of their limitations or behaviour beyond the scope of the original work.

## 2026 Reviewer Guidelines

In this project, we need to keep in mind that our goal is having a competitive submission to the NeurIPS conference, hence, we need to consider the following reviewer guidelines.

Below is a description of the questions you will be asked on the review form for each paper and some guidelines on what to consider when answering these questions. Feel free to use the NeurIPS paper checklist included in each paper as a tool when preparing your review. Remember that answering “no” to some questions is typically not grounds for rejection. When writing your review, please keep in mind that after decisions have been made, reviews and meta-reviews of accepted papers and opted-in rejected papers will be made public.

1. **Summary**: Briefly summarize the paper and its contributions. This is not the place to critique the paper; the authors should generally agree with a well-written summary. This is also not the place to paste the abstract—please provide the summary in your own understanding after reading.

2. **Strengths and Weaknesses**: Please provide a thorough assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the paper. A good mental framing for strengths and weaknesses is to think of reasons you might accept or reject the paper. Please touch on the following dimensions:

    2.1 **Quality**: Is the submission technically sound? Are claims well supported (e.g., by theoretical analysis or experimental results)? Are the methods used appropriate? Is this a complete piece of work or work in progress? Are the authors careful and honest about evaluating both the strengths and weaknesses of their work?

    2.2 **Clarity**: Is the submission clearly written? Is it well organized? (If not, please make constructive suggestions for improving its clarity.) Does it adequately inform the reader? (Note that a superbly written paper provides enough information for an expert reader to reproduce its results.)
    
    2.3 **Significance**: Are the results impactful for the community? Are others (researchers or practitioners) likely to use the ideas or build on them? Does the submission address a difficult task in a better way than previous work? Does it advance our understanding/knowledge on the topic in a demonstrable way? Does it provide unique data, unique conclusions about existing data, or a unique theoretical or experimental approach?

    2.4 **Originality**: Does the work provide new insights, deepen understanding, or highlight important properties of existing methods? Is it clear how this work differs from previous contributions, with relevant citations provided? Does the work introduce novel tasks or methods that advance the field? Does this work offer a novel combination of existing techniques, and is the reasoning behind this combination well-articulated? **As the questions above indicates, originality does not necessarily require introducing an entirely new method. Rather, a work that provides novel insights by evaluating existing methods, or demonstrates improved efficiency, fairness, etc. is also equally valuable**.

3. **Quality**: Based on what you discussed in “Strengths and Weaknesses”, please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the quality of the work.
4 excellent
3 good
2 fair
1 poor

4. **Clarity**: Based on what you discussed in “Strengths and Weaknesses”, please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the clarity of the paper.
4 excellent
3 good
2 fair
1 poor

5. **Significance**: Based on what you discussed in “Strengths and Weaknesses”, please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the significance of the paper.
4 excellent
3 good
2 fair
1 poor

6. **Originality**: Based on what you discussed in “Strengths and Weaknesses”, please assign the paper a numerical rating on the following scale to indicate the originality of the paper.
4 excellent
3 good
2 fair
1 poor

7. **Questions**: Please list up and carefully describe questions and suggestions for the authors, which should focus on key points (ideally around 3–5) that are actionable with clear guidance. Think of the things where a response from the author can change your opinion, clarify a confusion or address a limitation. You are strongly encouraged to state the clear criteria under which your evaluation score could increase or decrease. This can be very important for a productive rebuttal and discussion phase with the authors.

8. **Limitations**: Have the authors adequately addressed the limitations and potential negative societal impact of their work? If so, simply leave “yes”; if not, please include constructive suggestions for improvement. In general, authors should be rewarded rather than punished for being up front about the limitations of their work and any potential negative societal impact. You are encouraged to think through whether any critical points are missing and provide these as feedback for the authors.

9. **Overall**: Please provide an "overall score" for this submission. Choices:
    
    - 6: Strong Accept: Technically flawless paper with groundbreaking impact on one or more areas of AI, with exceptionally strong evaluation, reproducibility, and resources, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
    - 5: Accept: Technically solid paper, with high impact on at least one sub-area of AI or moderate-to-high impact on more than one area of AI, with good-to-excellent evaluation, resources, reproducibility, and no unaddressed ethical considerations.
    - 4: Borderline accept: Technically solid paper where reasons to accept outweigh reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation. Please use sparingly.
    - 3: Borderline reject: Technically solid paper where reasons to reject, e.g., limited evaluation, outweigh reasons to accept, e.g., good evaluation. Please use sparingly.
    - 2: Reject: For instance, a paper with technical flaws, weak evaluation, inadequate reproducibility and incompletely addressed ethical considerations.
    - 1: Strong Reject: For instance, a paper with well-known results or unaddressed ethical considerations

    **The overall review section is the MOST IMPORTANT!**
